The flat layout consists in creating a folder with the package name and put the code files within this folder.

However, it was pointed out that, because of the way Python discovers packages, doing this can lead to very nasty bugs.\n",

    "In order to better understand why a developement team woul benefit from the `poetry.lock` file we saw in the prevous section, let's add a dependency to our package.

We don't really know what version of Numpy we want, but we know that we want something more recent that v2.0.0 because we don't want to deal with the deprecated things from the v1. To do that, we can put a constraint on the version of Numpy that we want:\n",

    "$ git diff pyproject.toml\n",

    "We now have one dependency listed in our specifications. But note that there is only a version constraint here, we are nowhere telling our users which version of Numpy to install. `v2.0.0`, `v2.1.0`, and `v2.2.1` would all be valid versions of Numpy. Moreover, if Numpy `v46.12.2` existed, it would also satisfy this constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, Poetry did more than that: it *resolved the dependencies*, meaning that it computed, from the constraints that we imposed, the exact versions of all the dependencies that should be installed. Since this process is sometimes called *locking the dependencies*, Poetry write the results of its calculations into a file called `poetry.lock`.\n",

Imagine we had our numpy constraint (>=2.0.0), but another dependency on a package X which itself depends on Numpy, but with a constraint <2.0.0. In this situation, there is no version of Numpy that would satisfy our specifications, and Poetry will fail to lock and install our package.

The former describes our package and, as part of this description, gives the list of dependencies with the version constraints, if any. Poetry takes this information and tries to solve the dependency version constraints we wrote. If it is successful, it writes them in the `poetry.lock` file. All users installing the package in development mode will then rely on this file and install **the exact same versions of all dependencies**.\n",
