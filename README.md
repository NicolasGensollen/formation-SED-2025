# Formation SED June 26th 2025

This repository holds the sources to build the materials for the morning session.

The tutorial's objective is to build a small Python package using tools and conventions of the Aramis team. Participants are encouraged to follow along by creating their own repository within their personal namespace. The repository that served as the reference for these materials can be accessed [here](https://github.com/NicolasGensollen/calculator-lib).

The online version of the tutorial can be accessed [here](https://aramislab.paris.inria.fr/workshops/SED/).
